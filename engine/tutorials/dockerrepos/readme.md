# Docker Hub

https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerrepos/

I was going to mostly skip this one, since I'm aware of Docker Hub and don't really have any reason to be pushing any of my stuff up, except for the section on automated builds. This might be useful at work, if we start wanting to keep a customized deployment. To keep the thing private means getting a paid subscription of some sort to Docker. It looks like I get 1 private repo with the free account I have now. The micro gets 5 private repos for $7/mo and small gets 10 for $12
