# A follow-along for the Docker site
I'm working through some of the tutorial material on the Docker site, and thought I'd throw this up here. As of this writing, my work with Docker has been extra-curricular, but it's being discussed seriously where I work, so I thought I'd get a little more systematic in my approach. I tried to follow the site's layout, directory-wise, but likely slipped here and there.

Mostly, it's just my own observations. Take it for what it's worth. YMMV.
